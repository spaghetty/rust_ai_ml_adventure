This repository contains the code and journey of learning and applying the **Burn deep learning framework** in **Rust**. It's a live document of building understanding from the ground up, culminating in practical examples like MNIST digit recognition.

## Our Goal:

To clearly demonstrate and document the process of building neural networks with Burn, covering:

âœ“ Tensors & Automatic Differentiation

âœ“ Modular Network Design

âœ“ Data Loading & Batching Pipelines

âœ“ Training Loops with the Burn `Learner`

âœ“ Saving, Loading, and Inferring with Models

## Why This Matters:

* **Showcasing Burn:** A powerful, modern deep learning toolkit for Rust.
* **Rust for Speed & Safety:** Leveraging Rust's strengths in the AI/ML domain.
* **Practical Learning Resource:** Provides working examples and a relatable learning path for newcomers.

Follow along, contribute, or use the examples to kickstart your own AI projects in Rust!

### Best way to learn

If you are curious, or want to try something please contribute to this project.
You can contribute with:
 * pull requests for improvement
 * issue for unclear part or improvement ideas
 * requests for missing area to explore.

Working together is the best aproach to learn and grow

### Getting Started (Example)

To run the examples (once you have Rust and Cargo installed):

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:spaghetty/rust_ai_ml_adventure.git
    cd rust_ai_ml_adventure
    ```
2.  To run the training for an example (e.g., from the MNIST project):
    ```bash
    cargo run --example <name_of_the_example> ##(eg. base_tensor)
    ```
3.  To run inference with a trained model (specific command might vary per example):
    ```bash
    cargo test
    cargo test test_tensor ##(eg. single file)
    ```
